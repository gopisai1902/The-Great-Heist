# The Great Heist

The Great Heist is a web application. This is actually a game which commits to assess the soft skills of the players. The player goes through 5 levels, Each level representing a single question.There is a token and a key present in Level 3. If the user is able to solve all the questions correctly and had picked both the token and the key then the game will be successfully completed.

## Softskills Assessed
The soft skills that I have involved in  this project are:
1. Testing the intelligence, 
2. Testing logical thinking, 
3. Testing the vision,
4. Testing perseverance,
4. Building curiosity in users.

## Way to win the game
The player goes through 5 levels, Each level representing a single question.There is a token and a key present in Level 3. If the user is able to solve all the questions correctly and had picked both the token and the key then the game will be successfully completed.


## Deadends in the game
1. If a player does any Questions wrong, then he is diverted to a Extra question.
If he also fails to answer the extra question correctly then he is defeated. 
2. If the Player answers the extra question correctly,then he can come back and retry the question he did wrong. After coming back the player should answer every question correctly, if he fails to answer coming questions correctly then the player is considered as defeated.
3. There is a Key and a Token Placed in Question 3. If the Player fails to pick any of them, the player gets defeated  
even if he Answers everything correctly.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
